However, the SQLite autoincrement feature, whether implicitly or explicitly enabled, requires that the name of the column’s type is exactly the string ***“INTEGER”***.

    "### Database Locking Behavior / Concurrency\n",
    "\n",
    "SQLite is not designed for a high level of write concurrency. The database itself, being a file, is locked completely during write operations within transactions, meaning exactly one “connection” (in reality a file handle) has exclusive access to the database during this period - all other “connections” will be blocked during this time.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Python DBAPI specification also calls for a connection model that ***is always in a transaction***; there is no connection.begin() method, only connection.commit() and connection.rollback(), upon which a new transaction is to be begun immediately. This may seem to imply that the SQLite driver would in theory allow only a single filehandle on a particular database file at any time; however, there are several factors both within SQlite itself as well as within the pysqlite driver which loosen this restriction significantly.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, no matter what locking modes are used, SQLite will still always lock the database file once a transaction is started and DML (e.g. INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE) has at least been emitted, and this will block other transactions at least at the point that they also attempt to emit DML. By default, the length of time on this block is very short before it times out with an error.\n",
    "\n",
    "This behavior becomes more critical when used in conjunction with the SQLAlchemy ORM. SQLAlchemy’s Session object by default runs within a transaction, and with its autoflush model, may emit DML preceding any SELECT statement. This may lead to a SQLite database that locks more quickly than is expected. The locking mode of SQLite and the pysqlite driver can be manipulated to some degree, however it should be noted that achieving a high degree of write-concurrency with SQLite is a losing battle.\n",

This setting can essentially switch SQLite between its default mode of ***SERIALIZABLE isolation***, and a ***“dirty read” isolation*** mode normally referred to as ***READ UNCOMMITTED***.\n",
    "\n",
    "SQLAlchemy ties into this PRAGMA statement using the create_engine.isolation_level parameter of create_engine(). Valid values for this parameter when used with SQLite are \"SERIALIZABLE\" and \"READ UNCOMMITTED\" corresponding to a value of 0 and 1, respectively. SQLite defaults to SERIALIZABLE, however its behavior is impacted by the pysqlite driver’s default behavior.\n",
    "\n",
    "The other axis along which SQLite’s transactional locking is impacted is via the nature of the BEGIN statement used. The three varieties are ***“deferred”, “immediate”, and “exclusive”***, as described at [BEGIN TRANSACTION](http://sqlite.org/lang_transaction.html). A straight BEGIN statement uses the “deferred” mode, where the the database file is not locked until the first read or write operation, and read access remains open to other transactions until the first write operation. But again, it is critical to note that the pysqlite driver interferes with this behavior by not even emitting BEGIN until the first write operation."
