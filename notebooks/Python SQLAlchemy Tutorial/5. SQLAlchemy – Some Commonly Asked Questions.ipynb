    "Albeit very powerful, reflection does have its limitations. It's important to remember reflection constructs Table metadata using only information available in the relational database. Naturally, such a process cannot restore aspects of a schema that are not actually stored in the database. The aspects that are not available include but not limited to:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Client side defaults, Python functions or SQL expressions defined using the default keyword of the Column constructor.\n",

    "#### Performance Overhead of SQLAlchemy\n",
    "\n",
    "Since SQLAlchemy uses the **unit of work** pattern when synchronizing changes, i.e., **session.commit()**, to the database, it does more than just \"inserts\" data as in a raw SQL statement. It tracks changes made to a session's object and maintain an identity map for all the objects. It also performs a fair bit amount of bookkeeping and maintains the integrity of any CRUD operations. Overall, unit of work automates the task of persisting a complex object graph into a relational database without writing explicit procedural persistence code. Of course, such an advanced automation has a price.\n",
    "\n",
    "Since SQLAlchemy's ORM is not designed to deal with bulk insertions, we can write an example to test its efficiency against raw SQL. Besides the ORM and raw SQL implementation of a bulk insertion test case, we also implement a version that uses SQLAlchemy's **Core system**. Since SQLAlchemy's Core is a thin layer of abstraction above the raw SQL, we expect it to achieve comparable level of performance to raw SQL."

    "\n",
    "Although triggers are not directly supported, you can easily write them in raw SQL and hook them up using custom DDL and SQLAlchemy events."
