    "#### Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "In the previous article, we made a comparison between SQLAlchemy and other Python ORMs. In this article, we are going to take a deeper look at SQLAlchemy's ORM and Expression Language and use an example to showcase their empowering API and easy-to-understand Python structures.\n",
    "\n",
    "Not only does the SQLAlchemy ORM provide a way to map database concepts into the Python space, it also provides a convenient Pythonic querying API. To find something in an SQLAlchemy database using ORM is pleasant, since everything is straightforward and the query results are returned as Python objects, as well as the query parameters.\n",
    "\n",
    "The SQLAlchemy Expression Language provides a system for the programmers to write \"SQL statements\" using Python constructs. These constructs are modeled to resemble those of the underlying database as closely as possible, while hiding the difference between various database backends from the user. Although these constructs aim to represent equivalent concepts between backends with consistent structures, they do not conceal useful backend-specific features. Therefore, the Expression Language provides a way for the programmers to write backend-neutral expressions, while allowing the programmers to take advantage of specific backend features if they really want to.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Expression Language complements the Object Relational Mapper. Whereas the ORM presents an abstracted pattern of usage mapping database concepts into Python's space, where models are used to map tables and relationships are used to map many-to-many through an association table and one-to-one through a foreign key, the Expression Language is used to directly represent more primitive constructs in a database without opinion.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### An example with departments and employees\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's use an example to illustrate how to use the expression language in a database with two tables department and employee. A department has many employees while an employee belongs to at most one department. Therefore, the database could be designed as follows:"
